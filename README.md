In this project we are prompting the end user to complete a coding quiz.
When you press the start button the questions and answer selections show.
This also starts a countdown timer starting from 60 seconds.
When the user answers the question correctly, the prompt moves to the next question and increments the score count.
If the user answers incorrectly, the score stays the same value and prompts the user for the next answer to the next question.
When all the questions are answered, or the time runs out, the quiz is over and prompts the user to save their score in local storage in the web browser.\
